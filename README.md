# TractographyMetrics
Evaluation of tractograms using diffusion and geometrical metrics.

## Functionality

## Installation and Usage.

To set up TractographyMetrics the first thing you need to do is obtaining a copy of it.

To download TractographyMetrics the first thing you should do is open a terminal and move to the directory where you want it to
be installed.

For example, for an installation in the desktop of a MacOS system write:
```sh
$ cd /User/youraccountname/Desktop
```

Get a copy using git:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/aledelmo/TractographyMetrics
```

Enter in your freshly downloaded folder:
```sh
$ cd TractographyMetrics
```

Some dependencies are required for a smooth experience. To install everything needed, simply run:
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies: **dipy**, **VTK**, **XlsxWriter** <br />
Python3 Compatibility Dependencies: **future**, **six** <br />

Get the tractogram generated by your favourite software and run:
```sh
$ python -m tractography_metrics.py <tractogram_filepath> <output_txt_file> <query_filepath>
```

You should now be able to find all the stats that you were looking for in your newly created text file.

To add diffusion information to the analysis make use of the following optional keywords:

| short flag | long flag | Action |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| ```-bzero <filepath>``` | ```--b_zero <filepath>``` | Compute stats on the bzero volume  |
| ```-fa <metric_filepath>``` | ```--Fractional_Anisotropy <metric_filepath>``` | Compute stats on the FA metric volume |
| ```-md <metric_filepath>``` | ```--metric_filepath``` | Compute stats on the MD metric volume |

If you prefer to have yout output in a different format use the optional flags:

| short flag | long flag |
| ------ | ------ |
| ```-csv``` | ```--save_csv``` |
| ```-xlsx``` | ```--save_xlsx``` |

These allows to obtain, respectively, a CSV and an Excel output file

Additionally, tu further customize your output with an header use:

| short flag | long flag | Action |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| ```-hd <text>``` | ```--header <text>``` | Add any string of text to the stats |

If you are working on huge amount of fibers and you are experiencing computational time issues you can try to
downsampling the tractogram:

| short flag | long flag | Action |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| ```-r <resampling_percentage>``` | ```--resample <resampling_percentage>``` | Specify the percentage of downsampling of the tractogram fibers (value between 0 and 100) |

To update the tool, once entered in the folder using a terminal, use the command:
 ```sh
$ git pull
```

It is very important to keep the tool up-to-date to always receive the bug-fixes and to enable the newly developed
functionality.
